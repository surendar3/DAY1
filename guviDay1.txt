2.)HTTP1.1 and HTTP2
                          HTTP is a communications protocol used to connect to Web servers on the Internet or on a local network
In HTTP1.1 for every TCP connection there could be multiple requests and responses where the client can request several resources from the server at once.In HTTP2 ,it Uses multiplexing, where over a single TCP connection resources to be delivered are interleaved and arrive at the client almost at the same time. HTTP/1.1, which keep all requests and responses in plain text format, HTTP/2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format. This makes HTTP2 runs faster than HTTP1.1.

3.)objects and its internal representation:
                               objects are nothing but collection of key and value pairs.they are used to hold datas like personal details of person or about a vehicle etc.we can perform add ,remove and read datas in object.
example :
var person = {
  firstName: "guvi",
  lastName: "zen",
  age: 50,
};  
here person is the name of the object and firstName,last name,age are the keys in object and "guvi","zen",50 are the values in object person.
